item:

item:
	name: Pick of Destiny
	description: Your voice is ****in' powerful.
	stats:
		defence: 4000
		strength: 100
	end
	spell: Master Exploder
	NOTE: ADD INVENTORY SLOTS
	with different body parts in array
	part[0] = head, part[1] = torso, etc
	part[x] = left hand, part[y] = right hand
	Can equip different, say, gloves to each hand
	E.g. one on left that increases defence of item held (shield),
	one that increases attack of item held (sword)
end

item:
	name: Glove of Dwarvitude
	description: Gamebreaker
	stats:
		shenanigans: 2
	end
	NOTE:
	With greater Shenanigan stats, you can do things
	as in the Warrens
	Such as, with stat >=2 you can pick up and move the stairs
	With >=10 you can pick up pillars and stuff
	With >=5 you can combine silly things into portmanteau words
	(Swordchainflaillamp)
	Have a "downward map" that defines where each other area is
	below the current one
	If there is no mapping on a certain square, go to Void
	with Betweenford
	Also, make shenanigans REALLY OP at the end (stealing inventory slots etc) but really hard to get
	E.g. with stat of 2 you can place stairs in other places
	Some places lead to the Void, where you can fight Betweenford
	If you don't die, he gives you the Skill Tree
	Place a potion and something (or things) to get Potion of Duplication
	Use that on Glove to get Gloves (with +4 shenanigans)
	Now you can kill/loot walls - do it on one slightly off-coloured wall
	to get raw Shenanigans (temp. +5)
	With that, you can steal stats - steal Kobold's +1 shenanigan stats (hope you didn't kill them!)
	Maybe to make it harder you have to kite them to a door so you can get them all before it wears off?
	Now you can do that even with no potion - so steal other Shenanigan stats
	Maybe have one other thing, but either way once you have a stat of 20 you can, say, edit your own stats
	Or steal inventory/stat slots, etc
